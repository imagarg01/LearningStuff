- Symptoms of complication
  - **Change amplifications**: a simple change requires code modifications in many different places
  - **Cognitive Load**: How much a developer need to know to complete a task
  - **Unknowns unknowns**: When it's not clear which piece of code need to update to complete a task


## 9-Dec-2024 (Werner Vogels)
- In 2012 (21st century architectures)
1. Controllable
   - Decomposed into small, loosely coupled, and stateless building blocks
   - Automate your application and processes
   - Let business levers control the system
   - Architect with cost in mind
2. Resilient
   - Protecting your customer is your first priority
   - Integrate security in your application from the ground up
   - In Production, deploy at least on two availability zones
   - Build, test, integrate, and deploy continuously
   - Don't think in single failures
   - Don't treat failure as an exception
3. Data-driven
   - Instrument everything all the time
   - Inspect the whole distribution
   - Put everything in logs
4. Adaptive
 - Assume Nothing
 - Use late-binding

### Principles
- Building evolvable software systems is a strategy, not a religion. And revisiting your architectures with an open mind is a must.
- Evolvable architecture, where we could change components without impacting the customer experience.
- The architecture should be able to evolve with the business requirements.
