## Concepts

- A Chart is a Helm package. It contains all of the resource definitions necessary to run an application, tool, or
  service inside of a Kubernetes cluster.

- A Repository is the place where charts can be collected and shared.

- A Release is an instance of a chart running in a Kubernetes cluster. One chart can often be installed many times into
  the same cluster. And each time it is installed, a new release is created.

## File Structure

The directory name is the name of the chart (without versioning information).

1. Chart.yaml # A YAML file containing information about the chart
2. LICENSE # OPTIONAL: A plain text file containing the license for the chart
3. README.md # OPTIONAL: A human-readable README file
4. values.yaml # The default configuration values for this chart
5. values.schema.json # OPTIONAL: A JSON Schema for imposing a structure on the values.yaml file
6. charts/ # A directory containing any charts upon which this chart depends.
7. crds/ # Custom Resource Definitions
8. templates/ # A directory of templates that, when combined with values, will generate valid Kubernetes manifest files.
9. templates/NOTES.txt # OPTIONAL: A plain text file containing short usage notes

Helm reserves use of the charts/, crds/, and templates/ directories, and of the listed file names. Other files will be
left as they are.

## Useful Commands

- Search

```cmd
helm search repo << repo-name >>
```

you can find the names of the charts in repositories you have already added:

- Important points while you are creating your own chart

1. There are two type of helm charts:

- Application Chart: This is the most common type of chart and is used to deploy an application. Its default chart type.
- Library Chart: This type of chart is used to create reusable templates that can be used in other charts.

2. In helm one chart can be depends on any number of charts. You can define the dependencies in the Chart.yaml file.
