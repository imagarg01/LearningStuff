# WezTerm

## Workspace

In WezTerm, a workspace is a collection of tabs and windows that are grouped together under a single name. You can think of it as a separate "session" or "project" within WezTerm.

When you switch to a different workspace, you get a completely new set of tabs and windows. Your old tabs and windows are still there, but they are hidden until you switch back to the original workspace.

What are the Benefits of Workspaces?

- Organization: Workspaces are a great way to keep your work organized. For example, you could have a
  "work" workspace with all of your work-related tabs and windows, and a "personal" workspace for your
  personal projects.
- Focus: By separating your work into different workspaces, you can focus on one thing at a time
  without being distracted by other tasks.
- Persistence: WezTerm can be configured to remember your workspaces and restore them when you
  restart the terminal. This means you can pick up right where you left off.
