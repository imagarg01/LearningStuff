- **What money for me?**

I see money as a mechanism to achieve freedom to achieve my goals which I want to do for larger society. As one says
you can only do for society when you have enough for yourself. So, money is important for me to achieve my goals.

- **Does money make me happy?**

To a certain extent, i would say more than happiness it give me peace of mind. I want my family to be secure and happy 
where money plays a big role.

That doesn't mean I don't like luxury, I like good house and car but I am not obsessed with it.

I was born at a time when money was a scarcity, that doesn't mean I was not raised well. My parents gave me everything as 
per capacity. That scarcity helps me a lot to do hard work and achieve my goals. Not sure if that scarcity was not there 
I will be able to achieve what I have achieved till now.
