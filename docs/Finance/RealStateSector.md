- The real estate industry is dominated by small-unorganized players because it has low barriers to entry for new 
players. If an individual/entity has required capital, then it can easily enter into real estate development because 
most of the key functions like construction, marketing, designing, procurement etc. can be easily outsourced.

- Financing is easy, individuals/real estate players with land/buildings can mortgage them to banks and get money, 
which increases the competition in the industry.

- The real estate sector is cyclical having direct linkage to macroeconomic scenario, interest rates and income levels.

- A typical real estate project has a gestation period of three to four years and any adverse change in the macroeconomic
factors in the interim period can affect the cash flows of the developer.

- A large share of the funding mix in real estate projects being met through customer advances (typically 50-70%). Therefore, 
when sales in any real estate project slow down, it creates a serious funding crunch for any real estate developer. 
This slows down the construction progress of the project, which further impacts the sales as customers tend to avoid 
buying in projects, which are facing delays. As a result, a vicious cycle of deteriorating financial position of the project starts.

- During an economic downturn, banks tighten their lending criteria and as a result, builders find it difficult to raise
money from other banks. In addition, declining property values in the economic downturn further decrease the amount of 
money that a builder can raise by mortgaging its assets.

- Apart from cyclical fluctuations, in certain regions demand is subject to a high degree of seasonality, and weather 
conditions can have a significant short-term effect on sales levels.

- Real estate business is capital intensive in nature and the entities require huge capital during various phases of 
project construction. The acquisition of land for a project is more often funded through the promoter’s contribution, 
while the construction of projects is funded through external sources.

- The industry generally carries a heavy burden of fixed cost…Because most such costs are determined by the start of a 
project, ensuring adequate sales is more important in terms of profitability than controlling costs.

- Company with strong market position tends to have stronger bargaining power to contractors and customers. Companies 
with greater scale and market shares may be better able to attract capital to support growth, garner economies of scale,
enjoy better access to well-situated land parcels, garner some pricing advantage, retain access to the best sub-contractors
and vendors, maintain better sales performance amid adverse market environments, and support investment in systems to 
enhance sales effectiveness and better understand its target end market.
Financial flexibility could arise from factors such as an entity’s large scale of operations with strong financials, 
large, unencumbered cash flows, unencumbered assets and the flexibility to borrow against such assets

- Real estate business is a regional game and hence, regional demand-supply dynamics is very important.

- Developers with strong market reputation tend to have better capability to withstand cyclical downturns and ensure 
higher degree of business stability. This allows them to sell projects or lease inventory even when the industry outlook is tepid

- Meanwhile in condominium sales business, while brand power and product planning capabilities are important, property 
locations and selling prices are more important in terms of competition…Any advantage based on company size and brand 
power, therefore, is not necessarily absolute, and competition develops for each individual property

- Geographical diversity becomes important as demand-supply dynamics in real estate tends to be local in nature. 
A developer operating in multiple geographies will, therefore, be better protected against slumps than the one limited 
to a single geography, irrespective of the type of properties.

- Commercial real estate projects have a consistent revenue stream in lease rentals, whereas revenue from residential 
real estate projects can be lumpy…Commercial projects generate cash flow after project completion, whereas sale proceeds
from residential projects start pouring in during the construction phase.

- Industrial segment tends to be less capital intensive, with lower land and construction costs…maintenance and 
operating costs are low and lead to relatively high profitability.

## Assessment of RealState Companies

- The sector is impacted by transparency issues…lack of clear land title due to absence of land records, use of unsecured
loans from promoters for funding and intra group transactions are generally the norm. An investor should be cautious 
and do deeper due diligence before considering investments in the real estate industry.

- Real estate companies at times have a significant amount of contingent/off-balance sheet liabilities, which might 
skip investors’ analysis. These liabilities relate to various guarantees given to banks or govt. departments on behalf 
of itself or its subsidiaries/joint ventures and even group/promoter entities. 

- Investors face difficulty in comparing the performance of real estate companies both across different companies as 
well as for the same company in different time periods. This is because of multiple factors like discretions/subjective 
opinions in accounting practices like revenue recognition, huge differences between revenue recognition/profits and cash
flows due to the percentage of completion method of revenue recognition etc.

- Real estate companies are effectively a cumulation of many individual projects; therefore, while assessing the 
attractiveness of stocks of any real estate company, it becomes necessary for investors to use parameters, which assess 
the company from the perspective of underlying projects. This requires the usage of certain unique parameters and ratios, 
which are different from the ones we normally use for other manufacturing and services companies.

  1. A comparison of the area currently under development with the area developed until now is important to understand 
  whether the company has spread its resources too thin or it has taken up a task, which is too big for it to achieve.
  For this analysis, an investor can simply compare this data provided by real estate companies in their shareholder communications.
  2. Checking whether balance receivables from already sold area in the projects is sufficient to meet the balance 
  construction cost and how much the surplus, if any, is in comparison to its outstanding debt. If a developer can 
  easily meet its balance construction cost of projects from its receivables from already sold area, then it presents 
  a safer position in comparison to the case where a builder might have to generate additional sales to complete its 
  projects, which exposes the developer to high market risk.
