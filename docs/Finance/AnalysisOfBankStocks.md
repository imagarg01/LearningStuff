# Bank

## Total Assets

Its mostly loans, investements, and cash.

## Deposits

Deposits are a bank's Oxygen.  Without deposits, a bank cannot lend money or make investments. Having a good base of deposits is crucial for a bank's stability and growth. On a quqrter or annual basis, you want to see deposits growing steadily. If deposits are shrinking, it could be a red flag indicating that customers are losing confidence in the bank.

## Loans

Loans are the primary way banks make money. They lend out money to individuals and businesses and charge interest on those loans. When analyzing a bank's loans, you want to look at the types of loans they are making (e.g., mortgages, commercial loans, personal loans) and the quality of those loans. A high percentage of non-performing loans (loans that are not being paid back) can be a warning sign of financial trouble.

Loan to Deposit Ratio (LDR) is a key metric to evaluate how well a bank is utilizing its deposits to generate loans. A high LDR indicates that the bank is lending out a significant portion of its deposits, which can be good for profitability but may also indicate higher risk if the bank does not have enough liquidity to cover withdrawals. Conversely, a low LDR may suggest that the bank is not fully utilizing its deposit base to generate income.

## Assets Quality

For a banking business, asset quality is a critical factor to consider. This refers to the quality of the bank's loans and investments. You want to look at metrics such as non-performing assets (NPAs), loan loss provisions, and charge-offs. A high level of NPAs or charge-offs can indicate that the bank is taking on too much risk or that its underwriting standards are weak.

As NPA number of 1.5% or lower is generally considered good, while anything above 3% may be a cause for concern. However, these thresholds can vary depending on the economic environment and the specific market in which the bank operates.

## Profit Margin

PAT Margin = (Net Profit / Total Income) * 100

A healthy profit margin for banks typically ranges from 15% to 25%. However, this can vary based on factors such as the bank's size, market conditions, and geographic location. A consistently high profit margin indicates that the bank is effectively managing its costs and generating strong revenue from its operations.

ROA (Return on Assets) = (Net Income / Total Assets) * 100

A good ROA for banks is generally around 1% or higher. This indicates that the bank is efficiently using its assets to generate profits. However, ROA can vary based on the bank's business model and the economic environment.

ROE (Return on Equity) = (Net Income / Shareholder's Equity) * 100

A healthy ROE for banks typically ranges from 10% to 15%. A higher ROE indicates that the bank is effectively using its equity base to generate profits for shareholders. However, an excessively high ROE may also suggest that the bank is taking on higher levels of risk.

NIM (Net Interest Margin) = (Net Interest Income / Average Earning Assets) * 100

A good NIM for banks usually falls between 3% and 4%. This metric indicates how well the bank is managing its interest income relative to its earning assets. A higher NIM suggests that the bank is effectively generating income from its lending and investment activities.

## Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR)

CAR = (Tier 1 Capital + Tier 2 Capital) / Risk Weighted Assets * 100

A good Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) for banks is typically above 12%. This indicates that the bank has a sufficient capital buffer to absorb potential losses and protect depositors. Regulatory authorities often set minimum CAR requirements to ensure the stability of the banking system, so it's important for banks to maintain a CAR that exceeds these regulatory thresholds.
