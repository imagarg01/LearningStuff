1. Volume

2. On balance volume
Helps to understand buying and selling pressure. It is a cumulative indicator meaning that on days where price went up, 
that day's volume is added to the cumulative OBV total. If price went down, then that day's volume is subtracted from the OBV total.

3. Simple Moving Average
Moving Average (MA) is a price based, lagging (or reactive) indicator that displays the average price of a security over a set period of 
time.
Simple Moving Average is an unweighted Moving Average. This means that each day in the data set has equal importance and is weighted 
equally. As each new day ends, the oldest data point is dropped and the newest one is added to the beginning.

4. Exponential Moving Average
Specific type of moving average that points towards the importance of the most recent data and information from the 
market. The Exponential Moving Average is just like it’s name says - it’s exponential, weighting the most recent prices 
more than the less recent prices. The EMA can be compared and contrasted with the simple moving average.

5. Relative Strength
Consists of selecting investments that have been outperforming their market or benchmark.

6. RSI (Relative Strength Index)
The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a well versed momentum based oscillator which is used to measure the speed 
(velocity) as well as the change (magnitude) of directional price movements. Essentially RSI, when graphed, provides a 
visual mean to monitor both the current, as well as historical, strength and weakness of a particular market. 
The strength or weakness is based on closing prices over the duration of a specified trading period creating a 
reliable metric of price and momentum changes
