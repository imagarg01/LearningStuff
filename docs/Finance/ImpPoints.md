# Important Points


- Focus on companies which earn a lot of money (topline), use minimum amount to earn that money, pay the due amount of 
taxes on its profits and increase the sales (topline) & earnings (bottom line) year on year.

- Focus on companies, which use a minimum amount of debt and create assets that keep on generating revenue for the 
company year after year without the need for frequent expenses to maintain these assets.

- Focus on companies, which generate a good amount of cash flow from operations that can take care of their 
requirements of investment (CFI) and repayment of debt (CFF). If a company generates so much cash that after taking 
care of CFI and CFF, it still has surplus left, it is a dream company.


- Important points on PE and EPS
  - EPS contraction + PE derating = Wealth Destruction 
  - EPS expansion + Stable PE = Compounding 
  - EPS contraction + Stable PE = Timepass/Traps 
  - EPS expansion + PE rerating = Wealth Creation (Multibaggers)


- If a company reports both standalone as well as consolidated financials, then in such a case, it is advised that the 
investor should prefer the analysis of the consolidated financials of the company


## Management Analysis

- A comparative analysis of salary drawn by promoters and the profits of a company is a good parameter. The promoter 
should not have a history of seeking an increase in remuneration when the profits of the company declined in past.

- Successful execution of increase of production capacity especially by greenfield plants is a good indicator of 
competent management. It is very good if the capacity addition has been done without facing any delays.

- A company that has consistently increased its dividend payout with an increase in profits in past usually has good management.

- Purchase of shares of a company by its promoters is a sign of a good promoter. However, the selling of shares by 
promoters is not necessarily negative. Company’s shares are usually the promoter’s biggest asset and they usually sell 
it whenever any cash requirement arises in personal life.

## Lessons from Utpal Seth

- **Survivor bias can be misleading**
Survivorship bias is the tendency to extrapolate the performance of the stocks which have given good returns to the 
entire portfolio, while ignoring stocks that have gone bad.Sheth underlines that correctly attributing mistakes is 
important. Not doing so is essentially ignoring the reasons for the failures, and continuing with the same mistakes 
and the performance does not improve.

- **Agility and experimentation are good tools to have**
There are two types of decisions – reversible and irreversible.
  1. **Reversible decisions** can be made fast and without perfection, since they can be changed.
  2. **Irreversible decisions** require careful deliberation and can often lead to slowness.
If most decisions are looked at as being irreversible, it would lead to slowness, unthoughtful risk aversion, and 
failure to experiment sufficiently. As a result, it would lead to diminished invention.

- **Embrace mistakes and learn from them**
Making a mistake is not a crime, but repeating a mistake is a crime. Not learning from a mistake is the greatest crime. 
Learning from a mistake involves experimentation, iteration and taking decisions rooted in conviction.

- **Investments should be in sync with the degree of conviction**
Many investors often rue the fact that they either did not make exits or entries at the right time, or that they did 
not back their conviction with enough money. While timing the markets is impossible, backing yourself in an investment 
decision remains important. Again, this also offers an opportunity to learn from mistakes.

- **Probability of right investments and right exits**
Once investors find a good investment, they need to iterate the remaining ones to strike the right balance of a stock 
portfolio.
