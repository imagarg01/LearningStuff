## Before buying
- An investor should focus on investing in stocks of companies which are:
  - Growing at a reasonable pace
  - Have sustained profitability
  - Are generating free cash flows
    - Sales/profits are genuine and the company is not doing aggressive sales recognition, fictitious sales recognition 
    without cash collection
    - Ensure that the company does not have a capital intensive business model because the company is able to meet its 
    capex requirements from its cash flow from operations
  - Are conservatively financed [very low debt to equity (D/E) ratio:preferably debt free]
  - Having competent and share holder friendly management
  

## When to sell
- Deteriorating operating performance of a company
  - Declining sales revenue year-on-year -> At least two consecutive years of declining sales are essential before the 
  investor makes any conclusive decision about sales decline. The investor should not become worried about changing 
  trends in quarterly sales performance
    
  - Declining profitability year-on-year -> An investor should monitor both operating and net profit margins. She should
  become cautious if the profitability margins are decreasing year-on-year.

  - Declining operating efficiency parameter year-on-year -> Declining fixed asset turnover ratio, declining inventory 
  turnover ratio and increasing receivables days: it indicates that the management is not able to use assets of the 
  company efficiently and that profits are being stuck in working capital.
  
  - Continuously increasing debt -> it is essential that investor should notice the deteriorating trend of annual values
  in these parameters for at least two consecutive years before getting worried about them.

- Government start interfering with pricing policy and profitability -> If a company can't decide its product pricing due 
to government regulation or policies.

- Change in business dynamics whose impact does not sound temporary -> Because of some reason if company business model 
got crushed.

- Portfolio contains too many stocks, effective monitoring not possible -> In this case identify and sell weak stocks.
