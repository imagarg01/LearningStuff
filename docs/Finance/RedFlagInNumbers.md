## Inflating profits

### Playing around expenses:
Companies shows higher profit by:
1. Trying not to show certain expenses in the profit and loss statement (P&L) or

One of the methods used by companies to achieve this goal is to use the concept of **capitalization**.
Companies capitalize even those expenses in fixed assets, as per investors should be recognized as an expense in the P&L. 
As a result, the companies show lower expenses and higher profits in the year.



2. When they show expenses in the P&L, then they resort to some conventions that these expenses despite being present 
in the P&L do not reduce the profits.

Upon deeper analysis, the investor would notice that in such cases, the companies show a particular expense in the P&L 
but simultaneously show a transfer entry shifting an amount from the reserves to the P&L, which is usually exactly equal
to the mentioned expense. The net result is that the transfer from the reserves overcomes the impact of reduction by the expense.

As a result, the profit of the company remains unaffected as if, the expense simply did not happen.


### Playing around profits and losses from investments in financial instruments:
1. Companies had shown profits when they actually seemed to make losses.
2. In some other cases, companies showed profits when there were no profits.
3. In still other cases, companies showed profits on investments in circumstances where the investor is not able to 
justify profits using common sense.
4. In addition, we also came across cases where companies resorted to delaying acknowledgement of losses on their 
investments to the last extent possible. Only when they could not postpone it any further, then they recognized the 
losses after many years of investments losing their fair value.

### Refusing to spend on expenses that they are required to do and thereby showing higher profits.
### Changing accounting policies whenever it suits them to show higher profits. Many times, companies changed the accounting assumptions to show higher profits even though the auditors highlighted it.
