## Notes

- There are two kind of locks:
1. Intrinsic - They are built-in with every java object, whenever any thread entered
in a synchronized space it's acquire intrinsic lock of object.
2. Explicit - There is a Lock interface which can be used to explicitly acquired locks.
Provides more granual control over shared resources. There are multiple implementation
of Lock interface.
- ReentrantLock: //ToDo explain it with example
-
