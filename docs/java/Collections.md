When you are looking into Collections, focus on two characteristics:

- Allow duplicates elements or requires unique elements?
  - **Allow duplicates**: two elements in the collections can be equals()
  - **Unique**: no two elements in the collections are equals()

- Are elements ordered or unordered?
  - Whether the collection has (or does not have) a defined encounter order.
  - If you iterate an "unordered" collection, you get some order.
  - The order is not specified
  - The order might change unexpectedly.
